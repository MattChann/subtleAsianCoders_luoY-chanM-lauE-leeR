Set up a virtual environment by running the following in your terminal:

# If the above does not work, run with python3 (this may be the case if a version of python2 is also installed)
```

To enter your virtual environment, run the following:

```shell
. hero/bin/activate
```

To exit your virtual environment, run the following:

```shell
deactivate
```
